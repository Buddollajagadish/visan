Developer Documentation
=======================

This document contains specific instructions for VISAN developers.

Release checklist
-----------------
- check compiler warnings
- check documentation
  (verify output of code examples)
  - check links to python and numpy documentation in:
    - docs/developer.html
    - docs/index.html
    - docs/manual.html
    - visan/app.py
- verify screenshots in manual. When reproducing screenshots: 
  - Create them on Windows using the default theme
  - Use a white colored desktop to get a proper color near the rounded edges
  - Make sure that all windows are 600 pixels wide and 400 pixels high.
    The visanframe size is set in visan/app.py, the Product Browser in
    visan/productbrowser/frame.py and for other windows it is defined in
    visan/windowhandler.py.
  - Disable the sequence numbers in the window title for plots in the 
    constructors of visan/plot/worldplotframe.py and visan/plot/plotframe.py
  - Put a 'return' at the beginning of UpdateMinSize in worldplotframe.py
    (this prevents the window to grow beyond the 400 pixel height)
  - For main window make sure that:
    - version number is removed from window title
    - version numbers in welcome message are set to x.y.z
    - copyright year is set to 2002-20xx
- check all demo/example files
- increase VISAN version number in CMakeLists.txt
- update README (version number at top)
- update CHANGES
- after release, update https://github.com/stcorp/conda-recipes
  and use it to deploy the new conda packages of VISAN
